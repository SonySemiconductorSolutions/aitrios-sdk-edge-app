# Performance Benchmark Edge Application

"**Edge Application**" intended to benchmark the performance of a passthrough-like application on CI. Measures the time taken to execute different blocks of code (e.g. accessing the frame, uploading input tensor or uploading output tensor) on each iteration. These times are then uploaded to a server periodically.


## Package "**Edge Application**"

Check [README](../../tutorials/2_import_edge_app/README.md) for how to package an app.

Please refer to the [**`manifest.json`**](./package/manifest.json) for packaging the sample.
